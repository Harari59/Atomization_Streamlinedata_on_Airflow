# Airflow DAG for Data Ingestion and Elasticsearch Migration

This repository contains an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for automating the process of transferring data from a source to Elasticsearch. The DAG includes tasks for loading data, cleaning data, and migrating it to Elasticsearch. While data validation tests are not included in the Airflow DAG, you can perform them separately as needed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the DAG, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. **Airflow**: Install and configure Apache Airflow. You can find installation instructions [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html).

2. **Elasticsearch**: Ensure that you have an Elasticsearch instance set up and running. You will need to provide the Elasticsearch connection details in the DAG.

3. **Docker Compose**: If you plan to run Airflow in a Docker container, make sure you have a Docker Compose file (YAML) configured to set up your Airflow environment.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find the following files:

- `docker-compose.yaml`: A Docker Compose file that sets up the Airflow environment.

- `raw_data.csv`: A sample raw data file in CSV format. You will use this file for data ingestion into PostgreSQL.

## DAG Overview

The Airflow DAG consists of the following tasks:

1. **Load Data**: This task is responsible for loading data from the source. You should specify the data source and any required parameters in this task.

2. **Clean Data**: Data cleaning and transformation can be performed in this task if necessary. You can customize this task to meet your specific data cleaning requirements.

3. **Migrate to Elasticsearch**: This task migrates the cleaned data to Elasticsearch. You should provide the Elasticsearch index name and connection details in this task.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your Airflow environment.

2. Configure the following in the DAG file (`dag_data_ingestion_to_elasticsearch.py`):

   - Elasticsearch connection details and index name.
   - Data source details, including any necessary parameters for loading data.
   - Data cleaning and transformation logic in the "Clean Data" task if needed.

3. Place the DAG file in your Airflow DAGs directory, which should be a subfolder within the folder where you set up your Airflow environment using Docker Compose.

4. Start your Airflow environment using Docker Compose, ensuring that your DAG is recognized and loaded.

5. Start the Airflow scheduler to begin automating the data extraction, cleaning (if applicable), and migration process.

## Visualization with Kibana

For visualization and analysis of the data stored in Elasticsearch, you can use Kibana. Kibana provides a user-friendly interface for creating various types of visualizations, dashboards, and performing data exploration.

## Additional Notes

- If you require data validation, you can perform validation tests separately using a tool like Great Expectations or any other testing framework of your choice.

- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the Elasticsearch client library for Python.

- Set up proper error handling and logging in the DAG to handle potential issues during data extraction, cleaning, and migration.

- Schedule the DAG to run at appropriate intervals according to your data update frequency.
